# basic-Crypto2
Broken-frankenstein-monster, basic cipher implementations for no other purpose than helping me further my understanding of cryptography as a whole (will catch up to modern times in due time).

Also, I'm working through the challenges posed at the back of "The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography" (1999) by Simon Singh, so there's that.

## To implement (in no specific order)

- [x] Vignere square
- [x] Playfair
- [ ] ADFGVX
- [ ] Generic RSA
- [ ] RSA-1024 / RSA-2048
- [ ] AES

## Potentially
- [ ] Frequency Analysis
- [ ] SHA-1 (not secure 2018+)
- [ ] HMAC-SHA-1
- [ ] SHA-2
- [ ] MD5
- [ ] OAuth / OAuth2
- [ ] Blowfish
- [ ] Twofish
- [ ] Diffie-Hellman

---

## Forms of attack to implement (maybe)

- [ ] Dictionary attack
- [ ] Rainbow table attack
