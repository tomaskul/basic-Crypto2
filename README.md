# basic-Crypto2
Basic cipher implementations to further my understanding of cryptography as a whole. Project is working in somewhat chronological order, might catch up to modern standards at some point.

**NOTE:** Do not use any of these cipher implmentations anywhere! It's not hard to imagine that there would be more security holes in these implementations than the number key permutations the ciphers can generate. *TL;DR;* these cipher implementations aren't safe.

## To implement (in no specific order)

- [x] Vignere square
- [x] Playfair
- [ ] ADFGVX
- [ ] Generic RSA
- [ ] RSA-1024 / RSA-2048
- [ ] AES

## Potentially
- [ ] Frequency Analysis
- [ ] SHA-1 (not secure 2018+)
- [ ] HMAC-SHA-1
- [ ] SHA-2
- [ ] MD5
- [ ] OAuth / OAuth2
- [ ] Blowfish
- [ ] Twofish
- [ ] Diffie-Hellman

---

## Forms of attack to implement (maybe)

- [ ] Dictionary attack
- [ ] Rainbow table attack
